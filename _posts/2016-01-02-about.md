## {{ site.event_name }}

_{{ site.event_name }} is a project of [[local organizer]](#) in partnership with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI), PPEHlab’s  [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) project, and the Internet Archive's [End of Term Presidential Harvest](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/)._

**{{ site.event_name }}** brings together concerned citizens with experts in information technology, archiving and environmental science and policy. We need capable web-savvy and technical members of the public, librarians, and people with environmental expertise. Building on experience from similar events, everyone’s skills will be put to work in organized cooperation.

{{ site.event_name }} works to secure federal environmental data in advance of the Trump administration’s large-scale efforts to dismantle environmental regulation. This work is urgent since the Trump administration has vowed to cull crucial data from its websites.

Join us for a day of preserving valuable environmental data from attempts to undermine science in the public service. Bring your laptop, water bottle and snacks.
